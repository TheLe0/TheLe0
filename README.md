### About Me

Software Developer from Brazil, working day and night to increase my software developer skills. 
Working for <a href="https://www.coopsantaclara.com.br/">Cooperativa Santa Clara</a> as a regular job, coding mainly on .NET and NodeJS. And on the free time as a hobby for studies and personal projects i explore the Elixir word and other functional languages.

I work with backend applications, already worked with front end and mobile stuff, but backend is my home. In the free time I work and study Elixir and some others functionals programming languages (Scala and Clojure), just for RESTing in the free time for relaxing. ðŸ˜…

Nowadays I am more functional than object oriented. ðŸ˜œ

I'm open to colaborate on open source projects.

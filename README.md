Software Developer from Brazil, working day and night to increase my software developer skills. 
Working for <a href="https://www.coopsantaclara.com.br/">Cooperativa Santa Clara</a> as a regular job, coding mainly on .NET and NodeJS. And on the free time as a hobby for studies and personal projects i explore the Elixir word and other functional languages.

I work with backend applications and cloud solutions, already worked with front end and mobile stuff, but backend is my home. In the free time I like to work on my personal projects just for RESTing in the free time for relaxing. ðŸ˜…

I'm open to colaborate on open source projects.
